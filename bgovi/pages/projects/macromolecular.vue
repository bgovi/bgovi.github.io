<h1> Protein structure images  </h1>


<p>
Goal and Approach:

Steps:
    Image generation (Initial image guess) based on sequence prompt

    The less information available the further the guess is from the correct solution.

        dynamic assembly of equation based on avaialbe information. Equation guides localized search.

    Distoring images guided by an equation.

    Identifying best image

    Assembling image networks
